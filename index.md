# Data Engineering - Case Study - TransUnion

> Welcome to my case study where **I intend to showcase my skills which I believe are relevant for the role of Data Engineer I at TransUnion**. In this project, I have designed an ETL Pipeline for a distributed System. I aim to demonstrate my technical skills in data engineering, along with my ability to effectively work with different technologies to solve complex data problems.

## Overview

* This case study aims to solve the problem of extracting and transforming Data stored in flat files in one server, moving it to a different server over the internet, and loading it into a Postgres Database. 

* In selecting the dataset for this case study, I purposely chose Telephony adjacent data because I believe it aligns with the type of data the Engineering Team at TransUnion may work with. I thought that familiarizing myself with this type of data would be beneficial in demonstrating my skills and understanding of the role 

* To solve this problem, the tools and technologies used include Pandas for data extraction and transformation, Flask to create a REST API for transferring data over the internet, Airflow for scheduling and PostgresQL for loading the data into a database
